An [Interaction-Calculus](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/Interaction-Calculus) evaluator written in oCaml as an educational project to firm my understanding of the Interaction-Calculus model of computation.

Thanks to Victor Taelin and [HigherOrderCo](https://higherorderco.com/) for creating the original Interaction-Calculus project!

This is worded in my own way in my interpretation based on my own understanding because I believe that writing things in your own words is a great way to learn.
